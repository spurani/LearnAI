'''13.Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary 
numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated 
sequence.

12.Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as 
input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting 
them alphanumerically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the 
program:hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
