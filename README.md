### Hello!

Myself Shlok Purani with Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis from Seneca School of Arts and Technology. Currently working as a Data Scientist. Trying to make a transition in Artificial Intelligence by repetitive process called Learning. I am looking forward to collaborate on projects which solves real life or real world challenges using Artificial Intelligence.
