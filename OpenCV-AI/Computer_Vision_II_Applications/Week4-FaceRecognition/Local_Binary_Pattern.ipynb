                "Local Binary Pattern ( LBP ) of a pixel is calculated by comparing the intensity of neighborhood pixels with this pixel and representing the result as a binary number. LBPs are calculated on grayscale images. To calculate LBP for a pixel we take a patch in the image with this pixel at the center. If intensity of center pixel is greater than or equal to a neighborhood pixel we denote this comparison as 1 else 0. If we compare 8 neighbors around a pixel in a 3x3 patch, we get an 8-bit binary number denoting the texture around a pixel such as 11010001. For each neighborhood pixel there can be only 2 values (0 or 1). So for 8 neighbors  there are $2^8$=256 combinations possible for LBP code around a pixel. So in decimal we will have these encodings from 0, 1, 2 \u2026 upto 255.\n",
